##LicitaChain

Introduction

LicitaChain is an intelligence with the objective of tokenizing public processes. With an emphasis on bidding, we use blockchain functionalities to ensure transparency, immutability and responsibility for the execution of crucial steps to complete a public bid.

##How the project works

LicitaChain has two main components:

Frontend: responsible for visually representing the bidding process.
Backend: responsible for managing the flow of information and blockchain operations.
The Frontend is developed in Next.js and uses the Backend API to access blockchain data. The Backend is developed in Solidity and uses the Hyperledger Fabric library to implement the blockchain.

##Characteristics

LicitaChain has the following characteristics:

Transparency: all information from the bidding process is recorded on the blockchain, making it public and irrevocable.
Immutability: information recorded on the blockchain cannot be altered or deleted, guaranteeing the integrity of the process.
Responsibility: each stage of the bidding process is associated with someone responsible, which makes it easier to identify flaws or irregularities.
Goals

##LicitaChain has the following objectives:

Promote transparency and accountability in public processes.
Ensure the security and integrity of information.
Facilitate the control and supervision of processes.

##How to use:

To use LicitaChain, simply access the Frontend and provide the necessary information to start the bidding process. The Backend will then manage the flow of information and blockchain operations, ensuring transparency, immutability and accountability over the process.

##Contributions

LicitaChain is an open source project and aims to contribute to the full efficiency of the public sector, through technology it is possible to promote security and autonomy of public processes.
